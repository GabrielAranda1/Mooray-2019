# Introduction
Mooray is a movie guide that allows users to create an account and connect to other users in the community. Users can access movie pages and see information about those movies like release date, actors, directors, etc.

It was developed to a Software Engineering Lab Class/Graduation project from January/2019 to June/2019

## Built With
* Node.js - Back-end
* React.js - Front-end 
* Sequelize.js - Database connection and management 
* Chart.js - Dashboards and charts

## Functionalities
Users can, but are not limited to:

* Add and change information about their profile (name, picture, email and location)
* Mark movies as watched/unwatched
* Add movies to favorites list
* Create custom lists
* Rate movies from 0 to 10
* Post commentaries and reviews
* Report abusive/spoiler commentaries/reviews

In this project there is also an admin dashboard where they are able to:
* Access user navigation reports created with [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
* Access reports created by the community (admins are able to delete/dismiss these comments based on their judgement)
